# Challenge 7 Personal Planner - Harry Probert

A basic personal planner for business hours.

## Description

I built this project to implement new technologies I've learned, such as using libraries like jQuery UI, jQuery, jsDate, and to refresh my memory on Bootstrap and HTML creation, among other things. The personal planner allows you to organize your day by displaying the current date and using color coordination to indicate whether a time block is in the past, present, or future. It also enables you to keep a local history so that it persists upon refresh throughout the day. I ensured full functionality after completing each requisite provided to me, debugging as necessary and adding comments for readability and clarification of how my code works. I condensed my code by assigning functions and calling them as necessary.
