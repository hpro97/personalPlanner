# challenge6QuizzHarryProbert
this is a quick and fun quiz with javascript functionality

## Description 

I built this project to showcase what I've learned in class recently like ternary statements, local storage, append, and timers alongside everything else I've previously learned. I created a functioning quiz that keeps track of your score, lets you input initials, and keeps track of this on the leaderboard, it also allows you to clear the local history on the leaderboard. I checked for full functionality after completing each requisite provided to me and debugged as necessary whilst adding comments to facilitate readability and clarification of how my code works. I condensed my code by assigning functions and calling as and when necessary.
